# Weather Cylinder
A device that changes colors when the weather changes. You put an led inside of a jar and fill the jar with cotton balls, and then you 3d print a lid for it that is able to store all the wiring and circuits.

# Hot Shot Hoops
A device that tracks the amount of shots made on a certain basketball hoop. It makes use of two ultrasonic sensors placed above and below the hoop to determine whether a shot is made.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is making modifications for aethetics. The modifications that I made was adding a rainbow color mode to the LED rings which could also be activated by alexa. I also added a second led ring, which was the hardest part of this modification because I am not good with circuits. Adding the second led din't come with any instructions like the first led did, so I had to research and learn how to do it myself. The second led also required me to add code to the code that I was given, therefore requiring me to understand how the code worked, and how the led worked.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was to 3d print the lid for the jar. This was by far the hardest part of the project because of the difficulty of designing the exact lid I wanted with the correct shape and dimensions. In order to do this I had to learn how to use a software called Fusion 360 and had to watch many outube videos to learn how to use the tools in the software to make what I wanted. One part I particularly stuggled with was finding the right height for the lid because I needed a height that was enough to store all the circuits, but also not tall to the point of it looking funny.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.
